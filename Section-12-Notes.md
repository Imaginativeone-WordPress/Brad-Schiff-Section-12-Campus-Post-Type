    Note About Google Maps JavaScript API
    Hello everyone,

    Google has recently changed the way their Maps platform works. When I first created this course Google allowed everyone to use their Maps platform for free, but recently Google has made changes and now forces everyone to have a credit card on file with them in order to use their Maps JavaScript API.

    This incredibly disappointing decision by Google is out of our control, and I now do not personally recommend or endorse using Google's JavaScript Map API.

    I'm not going to remove the Google Map content from this course because it will still provide value to many of you who are working on projects for paying clients where having a credit card on file will not be an issue.

    I should mention that Google gives you a $200 credit every month; so unless your monthly bill would be over $200 you'd never pay money to Google. Well, this is true as of June 2020, but Google could change this in the future so please perform your own research before entering your credit card with Google Billing.

    Despite this, I'm still not comfortable with students needing to enter a credit card into their Google Developer accounts within an educational context, so please feel free to skip this map feature and continue moving on with the rest of the course. My recommendation is to skip the map feature unless you have a paying client lined up or are working as an employee and can have your employer's (or client's) credit card on file.

    For those of you who are comfortable having a credit card on file in your Google account you can follow the WordPress instructions in the next lesson.

    Thanks,
    Brad
